# Datasets

The MASS dataset formed the core content of the early Signal
Separation Evaluation Campaigns (SiSEC) (Vincent, Araki, and Bofill
2009), which evaluate the quality of various music separation methods. SiSEC always had a strong focus on vocals
and accompaniment separation. For a long time, vocals separation methods
were very demanding computationally and it was already considered
extremely challenging to separate excerpts of only a few seconds.

In the following years, new datasets were proposed that improved over
the MASS dataset in many directions. They are summarized in the table below:
